His withered, corpse-green body is no bigger than a human child's, yet his bulbous head is enormous by comparison, far larger even than that of the giant who is holding him. It wobbles and sways repulsively when he turns to focus his eyes on you. Like polished gemstones these two blank orbs glint in the flickering light of the chamber, their cold sharpness revealing the intelligent being that lies imprisoned within the crippled shell.‘Be not afraid of me, human,' he says, using a language similar to your native tongue. ‘I mean you no harm. My shape may not find favour with those of your species, but here in the Daziarn you must be prepared to disregard appearances if you are to discern the truth.'With a languid blink he dismisses the Yoacor leader and his guards and watches like a doting father as they descend the spiral staircase.</b></p>
