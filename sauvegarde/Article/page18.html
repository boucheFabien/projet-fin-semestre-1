She bows, and as she turns she mumbles something in her native tongue, before shuffling away to help her daughters gather the empty food bowls.‘She say it sometimes better for warrior not to know his future,' says T'uk T'ron, and rounds off his meal with a hearty belch. ‘We go now, yes?' You nod and the little Ookor captain orders his company back to the chariots.As you prepare to leave you notice the old fortune teller waiting near the door of the hut. She has something in her hand and, as you approach, she offers it to you. It is a large, wooden charm shaped like the wing of a bird. If you wish to keep this Ookor Charm, mark it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you keep strapped to your Backpack.With a wave, you bid farewell to the cheerful villagers and hurry back to your chariot.</b></p>
