Lorkon Ironheart's army is surging into Tolakos, transforming the chaos-choked grounds into a raging battlefield. At their head you see Lorkon, his silver armour and scarlet cloak tarnished with black blood, striking at the enemy with blurring speed and deadly accuracy. He leads a massive wedge of Meledorian warriors whose faces and armour are painted with magical runes to ward off the creatures of chaos. The Agtah melt before them, like ice before a fire, and flee in panic to the dark safety of the Nahgoth. The Meledorians give a rousing cheer of victory to speed the enemy's retreat. But their jubilant cries are soon stifled when, from the depths of the forest, they are answered by a thunderous roar.</b></p>
