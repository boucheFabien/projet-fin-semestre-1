The chariots screech to a halt and a score of Ookor guards leap from the riding platforms. They come scurrying towards you, their glass-tipped spears thrust before them. Their leader motions to you to sheathe your weapon or face the consequences. You ignore his signals and get ready to attack him. Then you see more chariots emerge from the city to reinforce the patrol. With the odds stacked so heavily in their favour reluctantly you decide to raise your hands and allow these ape-men to march you into their city under heavy guard.</b></p>
