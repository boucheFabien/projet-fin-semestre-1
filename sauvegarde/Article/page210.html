Quickly you dress and gather together your equipment before joining her at the Table of Visions. ‘I have chosen T'uk T'ron, my most able and trusted Ookor captain, and a company of his best Thas guards to escort you to Tolakos. He is familiar with the forest tracts of the Khat Trisect and he will ensure that you do not lose your way.'She brings forth a black box inlaid with sparkling gems and unlocks it with a star-shaped key, which she wears on a slender chain around her neck. ‘Take this, Lone Wolf, and keep it safe,' she says, handing you a pyramid-shaped Obsidian Seal.‘The war against the Chaos-master has made the Meledorians suspicious of all save their own kind, and they are wont to attack anything they fear could be an agent of chaos. When you meet them show them this seal and your safety will be assured.' (Mark the Obsidian Seal on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a Special Item which you carry in your pocket. If you already possess the maximum number of Special Items permissible, you must discard one in favour of the Obsidian Seal.) ‘Do not speak of your quest to anyone except their leader—Lorkon Ironheart. Seek him out. In him you can place your trust. While you slept we communicated with our minds and he has vowed to help you find the Lorestones.'</b></p>
