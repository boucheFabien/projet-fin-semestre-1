The sharp blade opens a fearful gash in his side but it misses its vital target. With a roar of agony the evil god staggers back, dropping his club as he clasps his side. Pain swiftly turns to a rage that fills him with a lust for vengeance and, with a hideous scream, he lunges at you with his gore-stained hands.This being is immune to Mindblast (but not to Psi-surge). The Ironheart Broadsword is a magical weapon and adds 8 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> for the duration of the fight.</b></p>
