The battle noise, especially the dying screams of the Ookor, play upon your mind as you run for the safety of the hills. When eventually you reach the first ridge, you look back at the bridge guiltily in the hope of seeing T'uk T'ron and his guards victorious. But your hope is in vain, for the only creatures alive and triumphant are the grey horde now feasting ghoulishly on the slain.Remorse clouds your mind and your senses give no forewarning of the menace skulking nearby. From behind a moss-covered boulder emerge six hideous monstrosities, crouched and snarling, each with the fire of chaos burning in their evil eyes. With a blood-curdling yowl they fall upon you and drag you to your knees.These creatures are immune to Mindblast (but not Psi-surge). Owing to the surprise and ferocity of their attack, you are unable to unsheathe a weapon and must fight the first two rounds of combat unarmed.</b></p>
