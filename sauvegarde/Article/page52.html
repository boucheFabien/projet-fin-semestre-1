You emerge from the foliage, your hands held open and away from your body. The other two spin round to face you, raising their forearms in reflex action at your sudden appearance.‘Hold it!' snaps the telepath to his companions, who are both on the verge of firing their bows. ‘He is the one.'They seem unimpressed by his judgement and refuse to lower their bows until you suggest that one of them looks in your pocket if it is proof of your identity they require.</b></p>
