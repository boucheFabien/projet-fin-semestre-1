<p style = "cursor:default ; font-size: 125 %; margin:auto; padding:23px ; " ><b>The walled city of Thas, home of the Ookor, lies before you, spread out along the centre of a narrow wooded valley. The low, pyramid-shaped dwellings are built around a tower of stone, its colour identical to the drab grey of the sky. Straight thoroughfares teem with Ookor, who pass freely and leisurely through the criss-cross of narrow streets.The path leads down to an open gate in the city wall, guarded by two of the squat-limbed humanoids. When they see L'yan-K'ril and his patrol approaching with you in their midst they give a call and a crowd comes rushing out of the city. They gather round you, chirruping and twittering excitedly, while L'yan-K'ril tries his best to calm them down.</b></p>
