You reach the centre of the bridge and are relieved to see that the damage is not beyond repair; whoever did this wanted to delay not destroy. T'uk T'ron signals to his guards to come and lend a hand with the repairs, but as soon as they leave the chariots a chilling howl echoes from the nearby trees. ‘Agtah!' moans T'uk T'ron, his voice a whisper of fear. ‘Creatures of chaos!'A shiver runs down your spine when you see them. Lumbering hordes of twisted shapes lurch from the trees on either side of the bridge and stagger drunkenly towards the chariots. They appear to be neither animal nor human but a ghastly fusion of the two. Now only two drivers remain with the onipa teams and T'uk T'ron is quick to see the danger. He commands the guards to return and leads them back across the bridge with his crystal sword held high.</b></p>
