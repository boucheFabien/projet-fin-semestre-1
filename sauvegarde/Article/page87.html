He pockets the Obsidian Seal (delete this Special Item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and motions you to approach his strange, long-haired steed.You ride pillion behind the saddle, yet the creature's shaggy coat makes for a comfortable seat as the steed gallops like a racehorse along the winding hill road. Huge tree trunks flash past—a blur of grey and brown—and the hills gradually recede until the forest rules supreme. The scouts leave the road and follow a smaller track which delves deep into this majestic timberland. They slow their pace, feeling safer now that they are back in familiar territory, and soon you arrive at a clearing. Hundreds of Meledorian soldiers are encamped here inside a perimeter wall of earth and logs. A cordon of sentries patrols the wall: they are alert and nervous, their eyes scrutinizing every shadow. A wheeled barricade of sawn timbers protects the only entrance and, at your approach, it is pushed aside to allow you entry. A small log cabin has been built at the heart of the tented encampment and the scouts bring their steeds to a halt near its front door. Quickly they dismount and usher you inside to meet their leader.</b></p>
