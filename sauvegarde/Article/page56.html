But they seem unmoved by their champion's death and show no desire to avenge it. The leader regards you with a cold smile of approval, for you have triumphed honourably in single combat and, by doing so, earned his admiration. He holds you with his eyes and projects a psychic message using a mind language you can understand.<i>We are the Yoacor</i> he says, telepathically. <i>We are the Lords of Yanis—the Shining City—and masters of the Abaxial of Czenos. Come, esteemed warrior; I invite you to join us. Come to Yanis where you will enjoy the rewards of the brave.</i>He beckons you to accompany him to his dragonmount. At first you hesitate, fearful of their intentions, but the thought of being left marooned in this inhospitable wilderness soon persuades you to accept the Yoacor's invitation.</b></p>
