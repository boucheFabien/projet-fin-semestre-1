They are demanding to know your name and your reason for wanting to enter the city of Thas, and they warn you that they will call out the city guard and arrest you if you do not give them the information they require. You tell them that you have come from the Beholder of Yanis and that you seek she who is called Serocca. Immediately upon hearing her name the two guards order that the gate be re-opened. The portal of grey stone swings back and they beckon you to enter. As you pass beneath the archway, a dozen of their kind gather round you, chirruping and twittering excitedly.‘Come,' says one of the guards, pointing to the tower. ‘We will escort you to Serocca.'</b></p>
