You stop just long enough to staunch the blood from your wound but, as you are about to continue, the scouts burst through the foliage and surround you, their bows held ready to finish you off. One reaches down and pulls you roughly to your feet, demanding that you identify yourself or suffer the consequences. You tell him who you are and suggest that he look in your pocket if he requires proof that you speak the truth.</b></p>
