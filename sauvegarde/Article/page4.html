Three gleaming bronze chariots, each drawn by a team of strange, horse-like creatures called onipa, are ready and waiting to take you to Tolakos. With the Ookor captain you climb aboard the leading chariot and grab the hand-rail as its driver cracks his whip. The onipa surge forward and, in a cloud of thick dust, the chariots race out of the city and along a stony road that cuts through the centre of the valley beyond.Three hours pass before you catch sight of a village on the road ahead. T'uk T'ron grins and points repeatedly at his open mouth. â€˜You want eat here?' he says, shouting to make himself heard above the incessant rattling of the chariot wheels.</b></p>
