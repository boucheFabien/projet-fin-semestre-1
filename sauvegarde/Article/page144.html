They call to you to come down from the roof and, when you appear at the doorway, they shower you with praise.‘We owe you more than our lives, Aonian,' says Lorkon, his strange blue eyes aglow with admiration. ‘Your great deed has saved our realm and put an end to the plague of chaos that would have corrupted us all. We are forever in your debt.'As he shakes your hand he notices the blade with which you dispatched the Chaos-master. ‘It is a good omen for my clan that the sword you used to banish the evil one was forged by my ancestors. I am doubly proud that it served you well. But now it must return to the Grand Sepulchre, for such is our law.'It is with some reluctance that you return the Ironheart Broadsword to its rightful steward (delete this Special Item from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>), for never before have you wielded as fine a sword as this.</b></p>
