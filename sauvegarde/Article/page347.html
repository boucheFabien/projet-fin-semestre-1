You tell him of your fall through the Shadow Gate and your flight from the storm, and in return you learn that he and his brothers are Yoacor hunters from the city of Yanis.<i>Come, we will take you to our realm,</i> he says, the words forming clearly in your mind. <i>You must tell of this journey to the Beholder. He will divine its worth.</i>He beckons you to approach his dragonmount and you step forward. The thought of being left marooned in this wilderness is all you need to persuade you to obey his command.</b></p>
