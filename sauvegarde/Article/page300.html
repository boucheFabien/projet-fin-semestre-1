Odel frowns and casts his eyes nervously at the surrounding mist. ‘I cannot enter,' he says. ‘I am not of clan blood. If you choose to go through that door you must go alone.'You sense that nothing will induce Odel to break his clan law, but you are anxious not to lose a valuable guide. ‘When I enter the Grand Sepulchre will you wait for me here?', you ask, hoping he will agree. Silently he considers your request. ‘Yes,' he says, without enthusiasm. ‘But search swiftly. The creatures of chaos are close. I can feel it in my blood.'You exchange stern smiles then hurry away through the knee-deep mists, towards the great door.</b></p>
