The others stop nearby and the guards clamber down from the riding platforms unsteadily, their legs weak and trembling after hours of riding along the bumpy track. They are familiar with this village and without hesitation they head towards a thatched hut that is set back from the road.You accompany the captain and his driver into the hut, stooping to enter the Ookor-sized doorway.
